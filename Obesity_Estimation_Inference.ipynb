        "The goal is to create a machine learning model with the ability to predict an individual's obesity level based on their eating habits and physical condition. The algorithm used is XGBoost since it is currently one of the most accurate algorithms available which was proven in the cross-validation process.\n",

        "Since our case is associated with health-related concerns, we want to minimize false predictions as much as possible, especially false negatives. According to the cross-validation results, it shows that XGBoost has the highest recall score compared to the other model. Therefore, XGBoost was chosen for this case.\n",

        "Through this project, we analyze health-related factors to create a machine learning model that can predict an individualâ€™s obesity level based on their physical condition and daily habits. In 2018, Indonesia had an obesity rate of 21.8% which is higher than the average world obesity rate of 12.5%. The Indonesian government plans to reduce this number to 3% by 2030. This machine learning model can help doctors and nutritionists in diagnosing their patients.\n",

The people in the dataset represents people from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia. The data was collected through a web platform survey and the final result was a total of 2111 entries with 17 features. The features represents the individual's physical condition as well as their daily habits. The target is \"Obesity Level\" which is represented by NObesity in the original dataset and divided into seven different classes, including `Insufficient Weight`, `Normal Weight`, `Overweight Level I`, `Overweight Level II`, `Obesity Type I`, `Obesity Type II` and `Obesity Type III`."
